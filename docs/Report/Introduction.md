# Introduction

This document provides an overview of the development of an offline typing test application. The project is designed to offer users a simple yet effective tool for measuring and improving their typing speed and accuracy.

**1. Project Overview**

*   **Objectives:** The main objective is to create an intuitive and responsive platform where users can practice their typing skills. The application will provide key performance metrics, such as Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage, allowing users to track their improvement over time.
*   **Context:** This project is an offline application, intended for users who want to evaluate and enhance their keyboarding proficiency even without an internet connection.
It can be used as a personal training tool, in an educational context, or for pre-employment skill assessment.
*   **Target Audience:** The application is aimed at a wide range of users, including students, professionals, writers, developers, and anyone looking to become faster and more accurate at typing.

**2. Typing Test Functionality**

The application's core mechanism is designed for ease of use and effective feedback:

1.  The user is presented with a paragraph of text to type.
2.  As the user types, the interface provides immediate feedback, typically by highlighting correct and incorrect characters.
3.  Once the test is completed, the application calculates and displays a summary of the user's performance, including their WPM score, accuracy rate, and the total time taken. This data helps users identify areas for improvement.
