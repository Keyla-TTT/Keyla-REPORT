# Introduction

## Project Overview

**Keyla** is a comprehensive typing test application designed to improve keyboard typing skills, speed, and accuracy. Inspired by popular online platforms like Monkeytype and 10FastFingers, Keyla provides a local-first alternative that operates entirely offline, delivering the same engaging typing test experience.

The project consists of two main components:
- **Keyla CLI**: A cross-platform command-line interface built with Kotlin Multiplatform for native desktop applications
- **Keyla API**: A Scala-based backend service providing RESTful APIs and data persistence

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Keyla project are:

1. **Local-First Approach**: Provide a typing test solution that works entirely offline
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) through a unified codebase
3. **Comprehensive Typing Assessment**: Deliver detailed metrics including Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, error tracking, and performance analytics
4. **User Experience**: Offer an intuitive command-line interface
5. **Extensibility**: Support custom dictionaries, text modifiers, and configurable test parameters
6. **Data Management**: Provide user profile management and historical test tracking

## Context

In today's digital age, typing proficiency has become an essential skill across various professional and personal contexts. While numerous online typing test platforms exist, they require constant internet connectivity to function properly.

Keyla addresses this limitation by providing a local-first solution that:
- Operates entirely offline without internet dependency
- Runs natively on the user's device
- Offers customizable test configurations
- Supports multiple languages and dictionary sources
- Provides detailed analytics and progress tracking

## Target Users

Keyla is designed for general users who want to improve their typing skills and prefer a local solution:

- **General Typing Enthusiasts**: Users who enjoy typing tests and want to improve their speed and accuracy
- **Offline Users**: People in environments with limited or no internet connectivity who still want to practice typing
- **Local-First Users**: Individuals who prefer applications that work without internet dependency
